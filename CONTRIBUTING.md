1. __Title Format__: The title should be concise and give a hint about the nature of the problem.
2. __Problem Description__: copy the raw code of the [issue template](https://github.com/Chitresh-code/DSA_Worksheet/blob/main/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) and paste it in the issue description and add the additional requirements.
3. __Tags/Labels:__ Add relevant tags or labels to help categorize the problem. Every problem must have labels for programming language (Python, C, C++, Java) as well as 1 label for difficulty level (`Level: Easy`, `Level: Medium`, `Level: Hard`). To make the problem elegible for Hacktoberfest, add the `hacktoberfest-2023` label as well.
4. __General Rules__:
